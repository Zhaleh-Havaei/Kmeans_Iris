# Kmeans Clustering on Iris Dataset

In this project the end goal is to implement K-means clustering algorithm and use it to analyse the popular Iris dataset. In this dataset there exist four features for three different species of iris flowers. The goal is to cluster the flowers based on their feature measurements. While libraries such Skllearn offer well-optimized implementations of k-means clustering and provide convenient interfaces to perform clustering on your data, my goal here was to use no pre-built implementations of k-means clustering and implelment from scrtatch to learn the basics of this algortihms as well as improving my programming skill in Python.
